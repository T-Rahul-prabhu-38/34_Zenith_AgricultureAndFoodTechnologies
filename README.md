# project KrishiSeva(KM)

Farmers face challenges in deciding optimal crops for their land, mitigating risks from unpredictable weather, and accessing essential services. This AI-powered platform leverages machine learning to recommend the best crops for specific locations, provides real-time weather alerts, and features a marketplace for farmers to lend or access critical services, enhancing agricultural productivity and resilience.


the Ideas we are working to implement right now:
- AI powered solution creating a complete plan for agriculture based on personal interests , crops , landscape and season of the year.
- DecisionTrees to give us the best crops that can be grown based on the land and the soil type.
- It has an image detection feature to detect any potential infection in the plants.
- A personalised marketPlace to help them lend or rent necessities and services.
- A alert system which can alert farmers of potential weather disturbances to improve the damage control.
- A SMS system to regularly give them updates about sustainable practices based on the types of crops grown by them.
